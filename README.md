# :milky_way: Hello there !
:tomato: As an **illustrator** and graphic designer, I did an internship in web development to improve my knowledge, learn new skills and discover the work of a web developer !

:tomato: During my internship, I worked on several projects, first dealing with the **frontend**, then learning about the backend *(but it's not for me* :sweat_smile:*)*.
| Project | Request | Languages |
|--|--|--|
| :airplane: Booki | Designing the website according to the model | HTML • CSS |
| :spaghetti: Oh My Food | Create the website according to the model and make it dynamic | HTML • CSS
| :cat: La Panthère | Optimising and correcting an existing website | HTML • CSS
| :moneybag: Kanap | Integrating dynamic elements into an existing website | JavaScript

> :information_source: Except for the Kanap project, **all works are available via GitHub Pages !**

## :dizzy: Personal projects
:tomato: I'm working on different projects to continue my learning.

> **The concept ?**
> Design or redesign a website, starting with a model on **Figma**, then writing the code to build the website.
